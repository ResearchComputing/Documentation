# Files application 

The _File_ menu allows you to view and operate on files in different file spaces: your _home_ directory, _projects_ directory, scratch spaces, and (if you own one or are part of a group with one) access to _PetaLibary_ allocations.

Selecting one of the file spaces will open a separate browser window which will allow you to navigate the space in a graphical setting similar to a file browser on a personal computer. From here you can download, upload, create, delete, and open files.

> **_NOTE:_** Please use 
[Globus](../compute/data-transfer.md#globus-transfers)
to transfer files to and from `/scratch/alpine` or `/rc_scratch`. Additionally, Globus should be used if you have more than 1 GB of data to transfer. <span style="background-color: #FFF36D; color:black">Open OnDemand is not designed to handle large file transfers.</span>
