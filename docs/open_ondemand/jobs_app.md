# Jobs application

The **Jobs** application within Open OnDemand is the perfect tool for individuals who would prefer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) to submit and monitor jobs. Users have the ability to interact with both the [Alpine](../clusters/alpine/index.md) and [Blanca](../clusters/blanca/blanca.md) clusters with a few simple clicks. To access either of these tools, select the **"Jobs"** tab (pictured below). This provides the user with two options **"Active Jobs"** and **"Job Composer"**. Details of both of these options are provided in the subsections that follow.

Additionally, users can also cancel their jobs using this tool. To view currently running jobs, first select the **Active Jobs** tool, this will bring you to
