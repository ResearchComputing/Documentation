# Jupyter Session

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an excellent resource for interactive development and data analysis using _Python_, _R_, and other languages. Jupyter notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text, which provide an integrated environment to use, learn, and teach interactive data analysis. Users can obtain quick access to Jupyter Notebooks using a **Jupyter Session** on Open OnDemand. We provide users access to both the classic Jupyter Notebook graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a JupyterLab GUI. JupyterLab is a fantastic tool that provides a highly customizable GUI, which allows users to easily navigate multiple Jupyter Notebooks, the CURC filesystem, and install extensions. 

## Launching a Jupyter Session

1. Navigate to either the __Interactive Apps__ or __My Interactive Sessions__ tab and select **Jupyter Session**. 

2. Select the Anaconda version, Conda environment, and type of GUI you would like to launch the application with. The Conda environment configuration can be particularly useful, if you need to utilize Jupyter extensions. For more information on creating a compatible Conda environment for Jupyter sessions, please see the section [Creating a Jupyter Session Conda Environment](#creating-a-jupyter-session-conda-environment) below.

```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyter_session_configs.png
   :align: center
```

3. Specify a **"Configuration type"** and select the resources you would like to use. For more information on this functionality see [Configuring Open OnDemand interactive applications](./configuring_apps.md). 

4. When your Jupyter session is ready, you can click the **"Connect to Jupyter"** button to bring up a web page with the Jupyter interface. When there is high usage on the system, it may take several minutes to open a **Jupyter Session**.

```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyter_session_launch.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
```

5. After connecting to the Jupyter session, you should then be able to utilize Jupyter as if it were on your own computer! 

````{important}
* The first time the session starts, you are placed in CURC root. This allows you to access all of your directories. However, you will not be able to create a notebook in this directory. You should navigate to one of your CURC spaces. In the JupyterLab GUI this is done by going to **"File"** in the upper left-hand corner, selecting **"Open from Path..."**, and entering the path you want to navigate to (e.g. `/projects/<your username>`).

```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyterlab_change_dirs.png
   :align: center
```

* Sometimes it can be useful to create a custom Jupyter kernel, which allows you to switch between different environments without having to use the **"Conda environment"** field in the configuration. We provide detailed instructions on how to do this in the [Creating your own custom Jupyter kernel](#creating-your-own-custom-jupyter-kernel) section below. 

* Closing the window will not terminate the job, you can use the **“My Interactive Sessions”** tab to view all open interactive sessions and terminate them.

## Creating a Jupyter Session Conda Environment

In Jupyter Session applications you have the option to launch a Jupyter session using a Conda environment that you have created. This becomes extremely useful if you are using a package that requires extensions be installed in the environment that is launching the Jupyter session. In order to configure your environment so that it launches correctly, you need to ensure that the appropriate packages are installed in it. Below we provide the process needed to correctly create your environment using a JupyterLab terminal. 

1. Launch a Jupyter session by selecting the Anaconda version of your choice, specifying the `base` Conda environment, and checking the use JupyterLab checkbox.

2. Once the Jupyter session has been launched, open up a terminal in JupyterLab.

```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyter_session_open_terminal.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%
```

3. In your terminal, load the Anaconda version you wish to use e.g.
   ```
   [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ module load anaconda/2020.11
   ``` 

4. Follow our documentation: [steps on configuring your Conda settings via ~.condarc](../software/python.md#configuring-conda-and-mamba-with-condarc).

5. Create a Conda environment with the name and Python version of your choice (here we use `my-conda-env` and Python version 3.10)
   ```
   [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ conda create -n my-conda-env python=3.10
   ```
6. Activate your conda environment
   ```
   [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ conda activate my-conda-env
   ```
7. Install either JupyterLab **or** Jupyter Notebook (it is preferred that users install JupyterLab)
   - If you would like to install **JupyterLab**:
       ```
       (my-conda-env) [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
       ```
   - If you would like to install **Jupyter Notebook** (the classic version of Jupyter)
      ```
      (my-conda-env) [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ conda install -c conda-forge notebook
      ```
8. You can now install the rest of the packages you require in this environment. 

### Launching a Jupyter Session using `my-conda-env` Conda environment

1. Specify `my-conda-env` in **"Conda environment"** field. 
```{eval-rst}
.. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyter_session_use_env.png
   :align: center
```

2. Once the session is launched, it is also important to ensure that your environment is being correctly utilized. To do this, open up a terminal application and determine what Python and Jupyter are being used:
   ```
   [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ which python
   /projects/<username>/software/anaconda/envs/my-conda-env/bin/python
   [user@c3cpu-a2-u3-4 ~]$ which jupyter
   /projects/<username>/software/anaconda/envs/my-conda-env/bin/jupyter
   ```

   - The provided output should be utilizing the environment you created, as seen by the output `anaconda/envs/my-conda-env`. 
   - If your environment is not being used, this is usually due to one of two reasons:
       - You have incorrectly provided the name of your Conda environment
       - You have chosen an Anaconda version that is not the same as the one you used to install your Conda environment
       
  In both of these scenarios, you can confirm that your environment is not being used by looking at the `output.log` for your job:

  1. Select **"My Interactive Sessions"** in the Open OnDemand interface.
  
  2. Click the link next to the "Session ID" for your running job

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. figure:: ./OnDemand/jupyter_session_launch_circled.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%
  ```
  
  3. Open the file `output.log` by clicking it
  
  ```{eval-rst}
  .. figure:: ./OnDemand/output_log_file.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 60%
  ```
  
  4. If you see an `EnvironmentNameNotFound` this means that your environment is **NOT** being used

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. figure:: ./OnDemand/env_not_found.png
    :align: center
  ```

## Creating your own custom Jupyter kernel

[Anaconda](http://anaconda.com) is an open-source software that provides access to _Python_ and _R_ distributions, and it includes the _Conda_ package manager to easily install software and packages. Software and associated Jupyter [kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) other than _Python_ and _R_ can also be installed using _Conda_. The following steps describe how to create your own custom Anaconda environments and associated Jupyter kernels for use within a Jupyter Session. 

Follow these steps from a terminal session. You can get a new terminal session directly from Jupyter using `New`-> `Terminal`.

1.  Configure your Conda settings by following our documentation: [steps on configuring your Conda settings via ~.condarc](../software/python.md#configuring-conda-and-mamba-with-condarc).

2. Activate the CURC Anaconda environment

```
[johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ module load anaconda
```

You will know that you have properly activated the environment because you should see `(base)` in front of your prompt. For example, 

```
(base) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$
```

3. Create a new custom environment 

Follow our documentation: [steps on creating your own custom Conda environment](../software/python.md#create-your-own-custom-environment) and [Creating a Jupyter Session Conda Environment](#creating-a-jupyter-session-conda-environment).

4. Activate your new environment

```
(base) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ conda activate mycustomenv
```

```{note}
We assume here that you've named your environment _mycustomenv_; please replace _mycustomenv_ with whatever name you gave your environment!
```

5. Create your own custom kernel, which will enable you to use this environment in your Jupyter Session

__For a _python_ kernel__

```
(mycustomenv) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ conda install -y ipykernel
(mycustomenv) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name mycustomenv --display-name mycustomenv
```

* The first command will install the _ipykernel_ package if not installed already. 
* The second command will create a _python_ kernel with the name _mycustomenv_ with the Jupyter display name _mycustomenv_ (note: the name and display-name are not required to match the environment name -- call them anything you want). By specifying the `--user` flag, the kernel will be installed in `/home/$USER/.local/share/jupyter/kernels` (a directory that is in the default __JUPYTER_PATH__) and will ensure your new kernel is available to you the next time you launch a Jupyter Session.

__For an _R_ kernel__

```
(mycustomenv) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ conda install -y r-irkernel
(mycustomenv) [johndoe@c3cpu-a5-u15-4 ~]$ R
> IRkernel::installspec(name = 'mycustomenv', displayname = 'mycustomenv')
```

* The first command will install the _irkernel_ package if not installed already. 
* The second command will start _R_. The third command, executed from within _R_, will create an _R_ kernel with the name _mycustomenv_ with the Jupyter display name _mycustomenv_ (note: that the name and display-name are not required to match the environment name -- call them anything you want). The kernel will be installed in `/home/$USER/.local/share/jupyter/kernels` (a directory that is in the default __JUPYTER_PATH__) and will ensure your new kernel is available to you the next time you launch a Jupyter Session.

````{note}
* If you have already installed your own version of Anaconda or Miniconda, it is possible to create Jupyter kernels for your preexisting environments by following _Step 5_ above from within the active environment.  
* If you need to use custom kernels that are in a location other than `/home/$USER/.local/share/jupyter` (for example, if your research team has a group installation of Anaconda environments located in `/pl/active/<some_env>`), you can create a file in your home directory named `~/.jupyterrc` containing the following line:
```
export JUPYTER_PATH=/pl/active/<some_env>/share/jupyter
```
* If you need assistance creating or installing environments or Jupyter kernels, contact us at <rc-help@colorado.edu>. 
````


## Troubleshooting

* If you are a CSU or ACCESS user and are having trouble with packages that employ PERL (due to the `@` symbol), visit our documentation on setting up a user variable that links to alternate paths without the `@` symbol in [CSU and XSEDE/ACCESS usernames](../additional-resources/csu-xsede-usernames.md)
