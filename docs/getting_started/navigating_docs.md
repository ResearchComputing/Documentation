# Navigating CURC Documentation

CU Research Computing (CURC) offers a variety of services encompassing High Performance Computing (HPC), cloud computing assistance, and storage solutions. Many of these services are available to users associated with CU Boulder, Anschutz Medical Campus (AMC), Colorado State University (CSU), and institutions that are members of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC). Our team understands that navigating the various services we provide can be overwhelming for both new and experienced users. To aid users, we have constructed flowcharts that outline the core areas of our documentation that every user on our system should become familiar with. Please refer to the section [High Performance Computing Flowchart](#high-performance-computing-flowchart) for a diagram of how to navigate our HPC systems (clusters) and storage solutions. For a diagram of the various cloud computing resources we can assist you with, please refer to the [Cloud Computing Flowchart](#cloud-computing-flowchart) section. 

## High Performance Computing Flowchart

At CURC, we host two HPC clusters, Alpine and Blanca, along with various storage solutions. Before you utilize these resources, there are several items that you should take into consideration. To guide users, we've included a flowchart below that highlights the key areas users should focus on.

## Cloud Computing Flowchart

The Cloud Foundations Service (CFS) at CURC provides an additional layer of support between the cloud provider and the customer. The purpose of CFS is to manage the integration of the cloud with CU standards. Specifically, CFS provides assistance with the provisioning of public cloud accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP), cost estimation, billing against CU funds, CU internal network connection, consulting, and high-level architectural guidance. It should be noted that CFS customers are expected to manage their applications, data, and use of cloud services. Below we provide a flowchart that we believe identifies the key areas users of these services should read.
