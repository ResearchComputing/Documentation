### As a CU Boulder user, how can I login with Duo? 
::::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

Duo offers a variety of methods to log into your account. Depending on what you select when setting up your Duo account, you should have several different methods of 2-factor authentication when logging into RC Resources. 

(tabset-ref-ucb-duo-login-methods)=
`````{tab-set}
:sync-group: tabset-ucb-duo-login-methods

````{tab-item} Duo Mobile Push
:sync: ucb-duo-login-methods-push

**Duo Mobile Push is Research Computing's recommended method of 2-factor authentication.** Because Duo Push is tied to your physical smart device instead of a phone number or account, Duo Push provides a more secure method of 2-factor authentication than either SMS or phone call.

1. Type: `ssh <username>@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line. For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`.
2. Enter your identikey password when prompted. 
3. Wait for a push to your phone.  

	![](./faq_images/duo_app2.png) ![](./faq_images/duo_app1.png)

```{note} 
Duo push is tied to your device so [you will need to add or remove your device if you get a new phone.](#as-a-cu-boulder-user-how-can-i-manage-my-duo-devices)

There is also an option to generate a temporary passcode from within the Duo app. This passcode can be used to log into <https://duo.colorado.edu>.
```

````

````{tab-item} Duo SMS
:sync: ucb-duo-login-methods-sms

If you prefer to not use the Duo app or if you don't have a smart device, then Duo offers an SMS method of 2-factor authentication:

1. Type: `ssh <username>@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line. For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`.
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,sms`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 I would type: `Ih3artdu0,sms`.
3. A list of one-time-passwords (OTPs) will be texted to you via SMS. Another login prompt will appear on your screen. Using the first OTP in the list, login with your password as `mypassword,OTP`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 and my OTP is 330456 I would type (without quotes): `Ih3artdu0,330456`.
4. Note that the next time you login, you can either request a new list of OTPs using Step 2 and then enter the first OTP via Step 3, or you can just use the next OTP in the list, and skip directly to Step 3.

````

````{tab-item} Duo Phone Call
:sync: ucb-duo-login-methods-call

Duo also provides a phone call solution for 2-factor authorization if you only have a land line, or prefer to not use Push or SMS:

1. Type: `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line. For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`.
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,phone`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 I would type: `Ih3artdu0,phone`.
3. Wait for a phone call. Answer the call, select option #1, and you will automatically be logged in.

````

````{tab-item} Duo Token
:sync: ucb-duo-login-methods-token

If you prefer a physical device, similar to the Vasco OTP, you will need to arrange with RC staff to acquire a token. There is a small fee for this device.  Email <rc-help@colorado.edu> for assistance.

1. Type: `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line. For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`.
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,6-digit-number`. The 6-digit number is given to you on the Duo token.  For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0, and I press the button on the token and it is 123456, I would type: `Ih3artdu0,123456`.

## General High Performance Computing

### How do I check how full my directories are?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

You have three directories allocated to your username (`$USER`). These include `/home/$USER` (2 G), `/projects/$USER` (250 G) and `/scratch/alpine/$USER` (10 T).  To see how much space you've used in each, from a login node, type `curc-quota` as follows:

```
[janedoe@login11 ~]$ curc-quota
------------------------------------------------------------------------
									Used         Avail    Quota Limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/home/janedoe                          1.7G          339M           2.0G
/projects/janedoe                       67G          184G           250G
/scratch/alpine1                      1050G         8950G         10000G
```

You can also check the amount of space being used by any directory with the `du -sh` command or the directory's contents with the `du -h` command: 

```
[janedoe@c3cpu-a7-u26-3 ~]$ du -h /scratch/alpine/janedoe/WRF
698M	WRF/run
698M	WRF
```

### When will my job start?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

You can pull up information on your job's start time using the `squeue` command: 
```
squeue --user=your_rc-username --start
```
Note that Slurm's estimated start time can be a bit inaccurate. This is because Slurm calculates this estimation off the jobs that are currently running or queued in the system. Any job that is added in later with a higher priority may delay your job.

For more information on the `squeue` command, [take a look at our Useful Slurm Commands tutorial.](../running-jobs/slurm-commands.md) Or visit the Slurm page on [squeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html)

Note that you can also see system level wait times and how they change through time by visiting the [CURC metrics portal](../compute/monitoring-resources.md) at [https://xdmod.rc.colorado.edu](https://xdmod.rc.colorado.edu)

### How can I get metrics about CURC systems such as how busy they are, wait times, and account usage?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

Please refer to our [XDMoD](../compute/monitoring-resources.md#xdmod) documentation, which is a portal that allows users to easily see CURC system metrics. 
::::

### How much memory did my job use?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

You can check how much memory your job utilized by using the `sacct` command and refering to the `MaxRSS` metric. This is done as follows where you can replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date you ran the job and specify your JobID:

```
sacct --starttime=YYYY-MM-DD --jobs=your_job_id --format=User,JobName,JobId,MaxRSS
```

If you'd like to monitor memory usage on jobs that are currently running, use the `sstat` command:

```
sstat --jobs=your_job_id --format=User,JobName,JobId,MaxRSS
```

For more information on `sstat` or `sacct` commands, [take a look at our Useful Slurm Commands tutorial.](../running-jobs/slurm-commands.md) Or visit the Slurm reference pages on [sstat](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html) and [sacct](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html). 

You can also view information related to service unit (SU) usage and CPU & RAM efficiency by using [slurmtools](../compute/monitoring-resources.md#slurmtools). Note that CPU & RAM efficiency statistics will be included in emails sent when a job completes, if requested.

### How can I see my current FairShare priority?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

There are a couple ways you can check your FairShare priority:

1. Using the `levelfs` tool in the `slurmtools` module. `levelfs` shows the current fair share priority of a specified user.
	
	You can use this tool by first loading in the `slurmtools` module (available from login nodes):
	```
	$ module load slurmtools
	```

	```{tip}
	slurmtools is packed with lots of great features and tools like suacct, suuser, jobstats, seff, etc._
	```

	Then using `levelfs` on your username:
	```
	$ levelfs $USER
	```
	* A value of 1 indicates average priority compared to other users in an account.
	* A value of < 1 indicates lower than average priority (longer than average queue waits) 
	* A value of > 1 indicates higher than average priority (shorter than average queue waits)
<br/><br/>
2. Using the `sshare` command:
	```
	sshare -U -l
	```
	The `sshare` command will print out a table of information regarding your usage and priority on all allocations. The `-U` flag will specify the current user and the `-l` flag will print out more details in the table. The field we are looking for is the _LevelFS_. The LevelFS holds a number from 0 to infinity that describes the fair share of an association in relation to its other siblings in an account. Over-serviced accounts will have a LevelFS between 0 and 1. Under-serviced accounts will have a LevelFS greater than 1. Accounts that haven't run any jobs will have a LevelFS of infinity (inf).

	For more information on fair share the `sshare` command, [take a look at Slurm's documentation on fair share](https://slurm.schedmd.com/fair_tree.html) Or [check out the Slurm reference page on sshare](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sshare.html)

### Why is my job pending with reason `ReqNodeNotAvail`?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

The `ReqNodeNotAvail` message usually means that your node has been reserved for maintenance during the period you have requested within your job script. This message often occurs in the days leading up to our regularly scheduled maintenance, which is performed the first Wednesday of every month. So, for example, if you run a job with a 72 hour wall clock request on the first Monday of the month, you will receive the `ReqNodeNotAvail` error because the node is reserved for maintenance within that 72-hour window. You can confirm whether the requested node has a reservation by typing `scontrol show reservation` to list all active reservations. 

If you receive this message, the following solutions are available: 
1. Run a shorter job or modify your current job's time so that it does not intersect with the maintenance window. One can modify your current job's time by using the `scontrol` command:

	```bash
	$ scontrol update jobid=<jobid> time=<time>
	```
2. Wait until after maintenance window has finished. Once maintenance has completed, your job will resume automatically.

### How can I check what accounts (allocations) I belong to?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

You can check the allocations you belong to with the `sacctmgr` command. This can be done by typing the following from a login or compute node:
```bash
sacctmgr -p show associations user=$USER
```
This will print out an assortment of information including allocations and QoS available to you. For more information on sacctmgr, please refer to [Slurm's documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacctmgr.html).

### Why do I get an `LMOD` error when I try to load Slurm?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note
The `slurm/alpine` and `slurm/blanca` module environments cannot be loaded from compute nodes. It should only be loaded from login nodes when attempting to switch between Blanca and Alpine environments. This error can be disregarded, as no harm is done.
::::

## Alpine 

### Why do I get an `Invalid Partition` error when running an Alpine job?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

This error usually means users do not have an allocation that would provide the service units (SUs) required to run a job.  This can occur if a user has no valid allocation, specifies an invalid allocation, or specifies an invalid partition.  Think of SUs as "HPC currency": you need an allocation of SUs to use the system. Allocations are free. New CU users should automatically get added to a `ucb-general` allocation upon account creation which will provide a modest allocation of SUs for running small jobs and testing/benchmarking codes. However, if this allocation expires and you do not have a new one you will see this error.  `ucb-general` allocations are intended for benchmarking and testing and it is expected that users will move to a project allocation.  To request a Project and apply for a Project Allocation visit our [allocation documentation](../clusters/alpine/allocations.md).
::::

## Blanca 

### Why do I get an `Invalid Partition` error when running a Blanca job?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

If you are getting an `Invalid Partition` error on a Blanca job which you know you have access to or have had access to before, you may have the `slurm/alpine` module loaded. From a login node, run `module load slurm/blanca` to access the Slurm job scheduler instance for Blanca, then try to resubmit your job.

## Software 

### How do I install Python libraries?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

For individuals who need to install Python libraries not included in our base Python or Anaconda modules, we recommend using Conda environments through the Anaconda module. Instructions for creating a custom Conda environment can be found on our [Python and R with Anaconda](../software/python.md) documentation page. 
::::

## PetaLibrary 

### Why does my PetaLibrary allocation report less storage than I requested?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

Every ZFS-based PetaLibrary allocation has snapshots enabled by default. ZFS snapshots are read-only representations of a ZFS filesystem at the time the snapshot is taken. For more information on ZFS Snapshots, please refer to our [ZFS Snapshots](../storage/petalibrary/zfs_snapshots.md) documentation. 

PetaLibrary allocation sizes are set with quotas, and ZFS snapshot use does count against your quota. Removing a file from your filesystem will only return free space to your filesystem if no snapshots reference the file. Filesystem free space does not increase until a file on a filesystem and all snapshots referencing said file are removed. Because snapshots can cause confusion about how space is utilized within an allocation, the default snapshot schedule discards snapshots that are more than one week old.

If you would like to set a custom snapshot schedule for your allocation, please contact <rc-help@colorado.edu>. Note that the longer you retain snapshots, the longer it will take to free up space by deleting files from your allocation.

## Open OnDemand
	
### Why is my Jupyter session throwing a `QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit` error?
::::{dropdown} Show 
:icon: note

Some of our Open OnDemand applications allocate resources, which can be limited to one session. All Open OnDemand applications that submit jobs to Alpine's `ahub` partition have this limitation. Currently, all applications utilizing the presets configurations will be submitted to the `ahub` partition. This partition provides users with rapid start times, but limits users to one Jupyter session (or any one job using the partition). In order to spawn another Jupyter session, you first need to close the current job. You can do so by shutting down your current Jupyter session or by [canceling your job manually](../running-jobs/slurm-commands.md#stopping-jobs-with-scancel).
