## Getting a CURC account

All individuals wanting to access CU Research Computing (CURC) HPC systems (Alpine and Blanca), Open OnDemand, and storage solutions must have an associated CURC account. CURC systems are utilized by a variety of institutions including CU Boulder, Anschutz Medical Campus (AMC), Colorado State University (CSU), and institutions that are members of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC). Given that CURC systems host a variety of institutions, each institution has its own method for creating a CURC account. To simplify this process, below we provide tabs that specify instructions on getting a CURC account based on the institution you are affiliated with.

:sync: logging-in-ucb

The process for obtaining a CURC account for CU Boulder users is straightforward. Simply navigate to our [Account Request](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/organization) page, select **"University of Colorado Boulder"**, fill out the provided information, and select **"Verify & Continue"**. Once the form has been completed and submitted, an automatic process will provision your account. Once you've received a CURC account, you will need to enroll in CU Boulder's Duo two-factor authentication service. After installing the Duo mobile app to your phone (available via Apple App Store or Google Play Store), visit [https://duo.colorado.edu](https://duo.colorado.edu) to enroll. 

````{important}
- Research Computing accounts are separate from your CU accounts. You must sign up for an individual Research Computing account if you wish to access Research Computing resources.
- Once your account is provisioned, please wait 15 minutes before signing in
- If you are having issues with DUO, please consult our [Duo Frequently Asked Questions](./faq.md#duo-multi-factor-authentication) section

## Getting access to CURC resources 

Once you have obtained a CURC account, you can proceed to logging in to CURC resources. Users accessing CURC resources will be connected to a login node. A login node is an outward-facing node within the research computing environment that users can connect to from their local machines. Once on a login node, users can perform a limited number of tasks:

+ Edit files
+ Transfer data
+ Submit jobs
+ Access storage resources  

```{important}  
The [login node policy](../additional-resources/policies.md#login-nodes) states that login nodes should not be used for resource-intensive tasks such as running code. For all other tasks, users should run batch jobs, interactive jobs, or use the compile nodes. 
```

Similar to obtaining an account, the process of logging in to CURC resources can vary based on the institution you are affiliated with. In the tab sections below we provide details on how each institution can gain access to our login nodes.

### Terminal access for different operating systems

```{important}
Not all users have the ability to access CURC resources using a terminal. Please consult the appropriate tabbed item in the previous section [Getting access to CURC resources](#getting-access-to-curc-resources) before proceeding.

````{tab-item} Windows 
:sync: terminal-access-windows

Logging in from a Windows machine requires the additional step of [installing the PuTTY ssh client](https://www.putty.org/) onto your local machine. This application enables users to connect to remote servers with the ssh protocol. Note that there are other ssh clients that enable Windows machines to connect to remote ssh servers; Research Computing recommends PuTTY for reliability and simplicity.

1. Open the PuTTY application on your computer
    * Under “Host Name (or IP address)”, enter `login.rc.colorado.edu`. Select “SSH” as the connection type. Click on “Open”.
2. Enter your Identikey in response to the “login as” prompt
3. When prompted to enter your password:
    * If you are logging in using Duo Push, simply type your Identikey password. You will then receive an authentication request from the Duo app on your phone. Approve the request.
    * If you are using Duo SMS, Phone Call, or Token login methods, instructions can be found under the [As a CU Boulder user, how can I login with Duo?](./faq.md#as-a-cu-boulder-user-how-can-i-login-with-duo) FAQ section.
    ```{note}
    As a security feature, PuTTY does not display any text while you type your password
    ```
````

````{tab-item} Mac
:sync: terminal-access-mac

Logging in with a Mac requires no extra installation on your local machine. Simply utilize the terminal application that is pre-installed with your operating system to access Research Computing resources. 

1. Under “File”, open a new finder window. Navigate to the “Applications” folder, then the “Utilities” folder. Open a terminal window and type `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu`, where `username` is your assigned username. Press enter.
2. Enter your password:
    * If you are logging in using Duo Push, type your Identikey password.  You will then receive an authentication request on the Duo app on your phone. Approve the request.
    * If you are using Duo SMS, Phone Call, or Token login methods, instructions can be found under the [As a CU Boulder user, how can I login with Duo?](./faq.md#as-a-cu-boulder-user-how-can-i-login-with-duo) FAQ section.
````

````{tab-item} Linux
:sync: terminal-access-linux

Much like with Macs, Linux machines require no additional setup to access Research Computing resources. Simply utilize the your Linux terminal to access Research Computing resources. 

1. Open a terminal window from your application menu and type: `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu`, where `username` is your research computing username.

2. Enter your password:
    * If you are logging in using Duo Push, simply type your Identikey password. You will then receive an authentication request on the Duo app on your phone. Approve the request.
    * If you are using Duo SMS, Phone Call, or Token login methods, instructions can be found under the [As a CU Boulder user, how can I login with Duo?](./faq.md#as-a-cu-boulder-user-how-can-i-login-with-duo) FAQ section.

#### SSH host keys

The first time you log into an RC login node you will be asked to verify the host key. You can refer to the keys published here to confirm that you are connecting to a valid RC login node.

```{note}
Each login node may support more than one type of key, but only one is used (or displayed) by your client at any given time.
