Amazon Web Services (AWS) Documentation

This applies to customers who are using a **Research Computing Cloud Foundations** managed AWS account.

## Landing Zones

Each managed AWS account is associated with exactly one landing zone. A landing zone is a consistent group of account configuration, networking, and security controls that are applied to all associated accounts.

The Cloud Foundations team currently supports two landing zones, **LCA0** and **LCA1**. The landing zone associated with your AWS account dictates how you should log in and how the account is designed to work. You should reference documentation below that aligns with your landing zone.

### How do I know what landing zone my AWS account is in?

You received a url to log into your AWS account as part of your onboarding.

If you login via [http://bit.ly/OIT-AWS](http://bit.ly/OIT-AWS) or [https://fedauth.colorado.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=urn:amazon:webservices](https://fedauth.colorado.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=urn:amazon:webservices), your are using **LCA0**.
