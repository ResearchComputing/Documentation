## Managing User Access with Grouper

### Adding Users

AWS customers can add team members as Administrators to their AWS account.
This is done using <a href="https://mygroups.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">CU's Grouper Tool</a>.
Note that changes can take up to 15 minutes to take effect.

1. Navigate to the Grouper Group for your AWS Account using one of the following methods:

   Method 1: Use the direct link that was sent to you in your welcome email to go directly to the group you wish to administer, and login using your <a href="https://oit.colorado.edu/services/identity-access-management/identikey" target="_blank">CU IdentiKey</a>.

   Method 2: Go to the <a href="https://mygroups.colorado.edu/grouper/grouperUi/app/UiV2Main.index?operation=UiV2MyGroups.myGroups" target="_blank">My Grouper Groups</a> view in Grouper.
   Login using your <a href="https://oit.colorado.edu/services/identity-access-management/identikey" target="_blank">CU IdentiKey</a>.
   Filter for 'AWS' (if you can't find your group easily).
   You will see a list of groups that you can administer.
   Select the Group for your AWS Account.
