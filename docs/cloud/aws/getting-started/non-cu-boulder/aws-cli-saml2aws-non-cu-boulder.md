## Accessing the AWS CLI Using saml2aws (Non-CU Boulder)

The **saml2aws** CLI tool is used to login and retrieve AWS temporary credentials.

### Prerequisites

1. This guide is only relevant if you are not a member of CU Boulder and require access to manage AWS resources owned by CU Boulder. If you are a member of CU Boulder, please see <a href="./aws-console-access.md" target="_blank">this guide</a> on signing in using your IdentiKey.

2. You have a chromium based browser installed on your PC.

### Install saml2aws

To install **saml2aws** (MacOS, Windows, Linux), visit the online documentation: <a href="https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws#install" target="_blank">saml2aws installation instructions</a>

Verify **saml2aws** is installed by running the following command (output should show the installed version):

`$ saml2aws --version`

### Configure saml2aws

Run the following command to begin the configuration process.
This only needs to be done one time:

`$ saml2aws configure`

Provide the following values for the configuration:

```buildoutcfg
Provider:    Browser
AWS Profile: saml (default, just hit the enter key)
URL:         https://federation-proxy.rmacc.org/aws
Username:    leave blank (just hit the enter key)
Password:    leave blank (just hit the enter key)
```

Example configuration input:

```
? Please choose a provider: Browser
? AWS Profile: (default, hit enter key)
? URL: https://federation-proxy.rmacc.org/aws
? Username:
? Password:
```

Example configuration output:

```
account {
  URL: https://federation-proxy.rmacc.org/aws
  Username: 
  Provider: Browser
  MFA: Auto
  SkipVerify: false
  AmazonWebservicesURN: urn:amazon:webservices
  SessionDuration: 3600
  Profile: saml
  RoleARN: 
  Region: 
}
```
### Using saml2aws

Using **saml2aws** involves logging in first using the `saml2aws login` command. Once logged in, you can then execute AWS CLI commands using the `saml2aws exec` command. You can also establish an interactive shell to run your commands in. Both methods are described below.

#### saml2aws login

Log in using the following command:

`$ saml2aws login`

**Note**: When logging in for the first time, you will need to add the `--download-browser-driver` flag which will download drivers for chromium based browsers, allowing the login page to pop-up in browser. The full command is as follows:
`$ saml2aws login --download-browser-driver`

When prompted for the Username and Password, just hit the ENTER key to accept the defaults you configured earlier. A browser window like the one shown below should pop up.

Select your institution from the drop down menu and click "Log On".

![](images/aws-cli-saml2aws-non-cu-boulder/cilogon-selection.png)

Log in using your regular institution credentials. You may be asked to authenticate with MFA.

If you only have access to a single AWS Account and a single Role, you will be immediatly authenticated with SAML.

If you have access to multiple AWS Accounts and/or Roles, you will be presented with a list of Accounts/Roles to select.  Select the Account and Role you wish to log in to.
![](images/aws-cli-saml2aws-non-cu-boulder/select-role.png)

Your browser window should then close and your terminal should have a similar output to the following

```
Selected role: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/Shibboleth-Customer-Admin
Requesting AWS credentials using SAML assertion
Logged in as: arn:aws:sts::XXXXXXXXXXXX:assumed-role/Shibboleth-Customer-Admin/ralphie@colorado.edu

Your new access key pair has been stored in the AWS configuration
Note that it will expire at 2022-04-21 23:10:34 -0600 MDT
To use this credential, call the AWS CLI with the --profile option (e.g. aws --profile saml ec2 describe-instances).
```

AWS CLI commands can be executed by using the format:

`aws --profile saml <aws subcommands here>`

Let's test your login from above by running your first AWS CLI command.

`$ aws --profile saml sts get-caller-identity`

You should see output similar to the following:

```
$ aws --profile saml sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:ralphie@colorado.edu",
    "Account": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::XXXXXXXXXXXX:assumed-role/Shibboleth-Customer-Admin/ralphie@colorado.edu"
}
```



#### saml2aws exec

You can use `saml2aws exec` to run a command using the login credentials from the `saml2aws login` command from above.
AWS CLI commands can be executed by using the format:

`saml2aws exec aws <aws subcommands here>`

Run the following command, which is equivalent to the command you ran above.
You should get the same output:

`$ saml2aws exec aws sts get-caller-identity`

#### saml2aws shell

Most times, users will want to establish a shell to type AWS CLI commands in to without the extra hassle of providing a profile or prepending with the saml2aws exec command.
Here's how it's done:

`$ saml2aws exec -- $SHELL`

Now try the following AWS CLI command:

`$ aws sts get-caller-identity`

You should see the same output from earlier.
Now you can run all the AWS CLI commands you want, or run a shell script.
All AWS CLI commands will run under the saml2aws login credentials from earlier.

### saml2aws Advanced Configuration

You can manually add profiles for each AWS Account/Role.
This is particularly helpful for automating **saml2aws** commands non-interactively.
Profiles are added by editing the %HOME_DIR%/.saml2aws file (ie. ~/.saml2aws).
Profiles can be added using the following template:
* substitute <account_alias> for the AWS Alias
* substitute XXXXXXXXXXXX for the AWS Account Number

```
[admin-<account_alias>]
url                  = https://federation-proxy.rmacc.org/aws
provider             = Browser
mfa                  = auto
skip_verify          = false
timeout              = 0
aws_urn              = urn:amazon:webservices
aws_session_duration = 3600
aws_profile          = <account_alias>
```

Example command for establishing an interactive shell in a single command.
Note that you will have to manually accept the MFA request.

```shell
$ saml2aws -a admin-<account_alias> login --skip-prompt --duo-mfa-option="Duo Push" --session-duration=3600 && saml2aws -a admin-<account_alias> exec -- $SHELL
```

You can run the `saml2aws exec` portion of the above command however you need.
For example, you can execute a shell script.
Again, MFA will need to be performed manually.
