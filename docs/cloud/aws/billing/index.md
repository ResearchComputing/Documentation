# AWS - Billing

Note: The data in the AWS Billing Console  doesnâ€™t always match with the invoices received (this is due to our reseller managing their billing to help pay for our discounts). To check for the actual billing, CloudCheckr is the right source to look at. Below is the complete document to view the billing in the CloudCheckr and to set Email Notifications.
