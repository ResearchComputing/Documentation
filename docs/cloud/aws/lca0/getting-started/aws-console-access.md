## Single Sign-On

Users access the [AWS Management Console](http://bit.ly/OIT-AWS) using their [CU IdentiKey](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/identity-access-management/identikey).
The Single Sign-On (SSO) URL is [http://bit.ly/OIT-AWS](http://bit.ly/OIT-AWS).
You can access your AWS Account from anywhere with internet access.  You do not need to have a VPN connection to campus.

4. Accept the MFA request on your device.
5. If you only have access to a single AWS Account and a single Role, you will be logged straight in to the AWS Console.
If you have access to multiple AWS Accounts and/or Roles, you will be presented with a list of Accounts/Roles to select.  Select the Account and Role you wish to log in to.
