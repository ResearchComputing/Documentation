# Managing User Access with Grouper

## Adding Users

AWS customers can add team members as Administrators to their AWS account.
This is done using [CU's Grouper Tool](https://mygroups.colorado.edu/).
Note that changes can take up to 15 minutes to take effect.

1. Navigate to the Grouper Group for your AWS Account using one of the following methods:

   Method 1: Use the direct link that was sent to you in your welcome email to go directly to the group you wish to administer, and login using your [CU IdentiKey](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/identity-access-management/identikey).

   Method 2: Go to the [My Grouper Groups](https://mygroups.colorado.edu/grouper/grouperUi/app/UiV2Main.index?operation=UiV2MyGroups.myGroups) view in Grouper.
   Login using your [CU IdentiKey](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/identity-access-management/identikey).
   Filter for 'AWS' (if you can't find your group easily).
   You will see a list of groups that you can administer.
   Select the Group for your AWS Account.
