# AWS - Billing

AWS provides numerous ways to predict, view, and manage your costs.

## Cost Estimates

The [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pricing-calculator/latest/userguide/create-configure-estimate.html) is a great way to estimate costs before deploying your infrastructure. If you'd like additional assistance in creating an estimate, please reach out to [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu).

## Viewing Costs

Costs can be viewed directly in the [AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html). If you are migrating from the previous landing zone (LCA0), you should no longer look at costs in CloudCheckr.

```{important}
Costs shown in the AWS Billing Console will be slightly higher than the actual invoices you receive. Our AWS reseller provides a small discount that is applied during the invoicing process.
```

## Payment

```{important}
By signing up for an AWS account, customers agree to pay for all costs they incur, even if they are unintentional.
```

AWS accounts are paid via CU Purchase Order (PO). We will provide guidance on setting this up as part of the new account on-boarding process.

## Budgets

[AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) can be used to send notifications and take other actions when a defined spend limit is reached.
