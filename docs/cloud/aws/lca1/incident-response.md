# Incident Response

## Security Incidents

All security incidents and *suspected* security incidents that occur in your AWS account must be [reported](https://www.cu.edu/security/reporting-incident).

```{important}
If you become aware of, or suspect, a security incident has occurred in your AWS account, please report it immediately to [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu). We will assist you with triage, analysis, and [reporting it to OIT Security](https://www.cu.edu/security/reporting-incident).
```

## Operational Incidents

If Cloud Foundations-supported infrastructure in your AWS account is not behaving as you expect, please let us know by mailing [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu). We'll do our best to get it corrected as soon as possible. Cloud Foundations provides support during official CU business hours.

```{note}
While we may be able to advise, support is limited for AWS resources not managed by Cloud Foundations. We are not able to assist with issues specific to customer-managed applications.
