## AWS Programs for Research and Education

Students, educators, and researchers are key drivers of technological innovation. AWS has two programs to enable customers to move their research or teaching endeavors to the cloud and innovate quickly and at lower cost.

### <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research/" target="_blank">AWS Cloud Credits for Research</a>

The AWS Cloud Credits for Research program (formerly AWS Research Grants) supports researchers who seek to:
1.	Build cloud-hosted publicly available science-as-a-service applications, software, or tools to facilitate their future research and the research of their community.
2.	Perform proof of concept or benchmark tests evaluating the efficacy of moving research workloads or open data sets to the cloud.
3.	Train a broader community on the usage of cloud for research workloads via workshops or tutorials.

### Application process

Amazon Web Services (AWS) will evaluate academic research support proposals on a rolling basis throughout the year. Typical review cycles are 90 to 120 days. Please plan accordingly. Due to the heavy volume of applications received, expedited reviews are not possible.

Awarded amounts will vary depending on the research proposal and service usage requirements documented in the application.

Student awards will be up to a maximum of $5,000.00. Faculty and Staff awards are not capped.

Awards are in the form of AWS Promotional Credit applicable to AWS services. Amazon EC2 usage supported by AWS Promotional Credit will be for on-demand and spot instances only.

Communication regarding applications and awards are via <aws-research-credit@amazon.com>

If you are awarded AWS Promotional Credit for no-cost usage of applicable AWS services, the AWS Promotional Credit will be good for the entirety of the one or until the credit has been fully utilized.

Please make sure to account for the duration of the AWS Promotional Credit in your project timeline.
