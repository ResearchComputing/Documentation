# CUmulus _(On-Premise Cloud)_

**CU Research Computing's CUmulus service was officially retired on January 1, 2025.** Users looking to transition their workflows to alternative cloud platforms can explore the following options:

* the National Science Foundation’s [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org) service, which is freely available to any US-based researcher through an ACCESS allocation. 
* commercial cloud options such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, which CURC’s [Cloud Foundations Service](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/cloudfoundations) can facilitate access to;  
* transferring instances to CS Cloud OpenStack, which is freely available to any CU [faculty/staff](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/facultystaff-resources/computing-resources-faculty-staff) or [student](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/students/computing-resources-students) (with a faculty sponsor); 
* other hosted services managed by the CU Office of Information technology, including the [OIT Container Platform](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/consulting-professional-services/container-platform), and [virtual or physical servers](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/consulting-professional-services/systems-engineering/pricing) through the [OIT Systems Engineering Team](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/consulting-professional-services/systems-engineering).
