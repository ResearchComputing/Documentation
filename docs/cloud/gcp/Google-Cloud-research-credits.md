### How long will it take for my application to be reviewed and approved?

In general, Google reviews and make decisions on applications within 4-6 weeks. You may be contacted by GCP team to discuss your application further if necessary. Please indicate any urgent requests or timelines within your application proposal.

### Can multiple individuals from the same research proposal apply?

Only one person per research proposal may apply.

### Can graduate students or PhDs conducting research apply?

PhD students conducting research may apply for $1000 in GCP Credit per year. Students on a Masters degree program are not eligible for research credits.
 
### Can I apply for more credits for the same project?

No, if you are a faculty member or postdoctoral researcher you are only eligible to apply one time to the research credits program.
 
### Can I apply for GCP credits multiple times?

PhD students may apply once a year for credits of up to $1,000 USD. Faculty and Postdoctoral researchers are eligible for one award of up to $5,000 USD.
 
### Can I receive another research credits award for referring other researchers?

Google's referral program allows you to receive additional credits for referring other faculty researchers to the research credits program. If you refer two qualified applicants to GCP's program then you can qualify for a new research grant. If this sounds like a path to pursue, please have your referrals apply to Google's program and share their university email addresses with us after you’ve confirmed with them that they’ve applied (with their matching university email address).

Please note that credits are awarded at Google’s discretion and not all applications may be supported.

### Who should I contact if I have any questions?
