# Courses using CURC Resources

Instructors who wish to lead a class using CURC resources must complete the [course intake form](https://forms.office.com/r/3Bx0Dp0635) at least 3 weeks prior to the beginning of the semester in which the course will be taught. Completing the intake form will ensure that CU Research Computing can determine whether adequate resources and support are available to meet your needs, and that resources are allocated appropriately.  Upon completion, a case will be automatically generated in CURC's case management system. A CURC team member will subsequently follow up with you in the case via email, to discuss details and begin provisioning resources as needed. 

Note that CURC conducts planned maintenance the first Wednesday of each month, which may impact resource availability between 7a-5p. Instructors should expect that resources will not be available during the first Wednesday of each month. The CU Research Computing Help Desk is staffed from 8:00a-5:00p M-F; support outside of these times or on campus holidays should not be expected. Response times vary based on staffing and ticket volume. 

The following resources are available for course support:

* Alpine
   * Batch or Interactive Compute on Alpine
   * Jupyter Sessions in Open OnDemand (Alpine)
   * RStudio in Open OnDemand (Alpine)
   * MatLab in Open OnDemand (Alpine)
   * Remote Desktop in Open OnDemand
   * Shared storage space for students (up to 1 TB)
   * Standing reservation for Alpine resources during class meeting times
   * Compute allocations if student needs exceed their `ucb-general` account
   * Assistance building software or conda environments to support the course

* Cloud
   * Custom JupyterHub hosted in the cloud (costs may be incurred)
   * Custom RStudio hosted in the cloud (costs may be incurred)

  * CURC staff can lecture on specified topics during the class meeting time (once per course per semester). 

Students are welcome to use RC resources on their own for class projects and can request access as a regular UCB affiliate via the link off the RC homepage at: <https://www.colorado.edu/rc>. Students are not required to complete the course intake form noted above. To request help, contact <rc-help@colorado.edu> and please indicate that the work is for a class project and any deadlines.
