# Alpine Allocations

## What are allocations and why do I need one?

In the simplest terms, an allocation is a way for us to specify your cut 
of Alpine's computational resources. Allocations are referred to as 
accounts in Slurm's documentation and are indicated by the `--account` 
directive:

```
#SBATCH --account=______
```

Allocations are required to run on CURC clusters. They help us keep track 
of system usage for reporting purposes and to ensure we have enough 
resources to accommodate all of our users.  

## FairShare, Priority, and Allocations

### Fairshare Scheduling
The idea behind fairshare scheduling is simple, even though its
implementation is complex: jobs submitted by people who have underutilized
their allocated resources get higher priority, while jobs submitted by
people who have overutilized their allocated resources get lower priority.

### Level Fairshare
A Level Fairshare (`LevelFS`) is a value calculated by [Slurm's Fairshare 
Algorithm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/fair_tree.html). A user's 
assigned shares (determined by their allocation) and usage (based on their 
job history) contribute to their `LevelFS` value. Information on how to 
check your `LevelFS` score can be found on the 
["How can I see my current FairShare priority?"](../../getting_started/faq.md#how-can-i-see-my-current-fairshare-priority) section of our FAQ page.

```{note}
If there are no other pending jobs, and enough resources are 
available, then your job will run regardless of your previous usage.
```

### Priority Score
When you request resources on Alpine, your job's priority determines its 
position in the queue relative to other jobs. A jobâ€™s priority is based on 
multiple factors, including (but not limited to) FairShare score, job age, 
resources requested, job size, and QOS. 

### Allocations

```{warning}
**Allocations for CSU and AMC are managed by those institutions.** Please see the **CSU** and **AMC** tabs in each section below for more information.

#### Alpine Allocation Tiers

**Trailhead:**

When you receive a Research Computing account, you are automatically 
assigned a **Trailhead Auto-Allocation**, which grants you a fixed share 
of `ucb-general`.

The Trailhead is a great allocation for smaller jobs or 
testing and benchmarking your code. However, if you consume more than your allocated share of `ucb-general`,  your `LevelFS` will decrease, causing your 
priority score to decrease. The end result is that your jobs will sit 
lower (i.e., longer) in the queue relative to other jobs.

One way to combat this is to apply for an allocation. In addition to the Trailhead auto-allocation (`ucb-general`) that all users are awarded automatically, CURC offers two 
additional tiers to accommodate larger computing needs on Alpine, called **Ascent** and **Peak**.

**Ascent:**

The **Ascent** allocation tier provides CU Boulder users 
with {{ boulder_ascent_SUs }} SUs over a 12 month period. Please see the table below for a comparison with other allocation tiers; application instructions are in the next section.

**Peak:**

The **Peak Allocation** tier is 
aimed at projects that will consume between {{ boulder_ascent_SUs }} and {{ boulder_peak_SUs }} SUs in a 
12 month period. Please see the table below for a comparison with other allocation tiers; application instructions are in the next section.
