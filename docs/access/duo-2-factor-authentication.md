# Duo 2-factor Authentication

Research Computing utilizes a 2-factor authentication utility called **Duo** that must be utilized in order to log into RC resources. **This document covers installing and logging in with Duo for CU Boulder users only.**

- For CSU Users please see [CSU's documentation on Duo 2-factor authentication](https://www.acns.colostate.edu/hpc/#remote-login)

Before you can use our large-scale resources, you will need to be enrolled in CU Boulderâ€™s Duo two-factor authentication 
service. If you are not presently enrolled, you can do so as follows: 

1. Download the Duo mobile app to your phone (available via Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
2. Once installed, visit <a href="https://duo.colorado.edu">https://duo.colorado.edu</a> to enroll. 

### Common Issues

If you are having issues logging in to CURC services with Duo, you can enroll, re-enroll, change devices, and manage your 
Duo account by visiting the CU Duo self-service portal at <a href="https://duo.colorado.edu">https://duo.colorado.edu</a>.  

If you are not receiving a Duo prompt when attempting to login to CURC services, the following are possible issues and 
solutions: 

Issue 1: Your Duo account may have expired. The university purges Duo accounts after six months of non-use.  You can 
re-enroll by visiting <a href="https://duo.colorado.edu">https://duo.colorado.edu</a>.

Issue 2: You have changed your mobile device (e.g., purchased a new phone). You can add a new device to your duo account by 
following the instructions 
[here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.md#i-have-a-new-phone-how-do-i-move-my-duo-onto-it).

If you need human assistance with Duo, contact the University helpdesk at <oithelp@colorado.edu> or call 303-735-4357. 

## Logging in with Duo

Duo offers a variety of methods to log into your account. Depending on what you select when setting up your Duo account, you should have several different methods of 2-factor authentication when logging into RC Resources. 

### Using Duo Mobile Push

**Duo Mobile Push is Research Computing's recommended method of 2-factor authentication.** Because Duo Push is tied to your physical smart device instead of a phone number or account, Duo Push is provides a more secure method of 2-factor authentication than either SMS or phone call.

1. Type: `ssh <username>@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line. For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`
2. Enter your identikey password when prompted. 
3. Wait for a push to your phone.

</p>

**Note: Duo push is tied to your device so [so you will need to add or remove your device if you get a new phone.](#managing-duo-devices)** 

There is also an option to generate a temporary passcode from within the Duo app. This passcode can be used to log into <a href="https://duo.colorado.edu">https://duo.colorado.edu</a>.

### Using Duo SMS

If you prefer to not use the Duo app or if you don't have a smart device, then Duo offers an SMS method of 2-factor authentication:

1. `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu` . For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,sms`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 I would type: `Ih3artdu0,sms`
3. A list of one-time-passwords (OTPs) will be texted to you via SMS. Another login prompt will appear on your screen. Using the first OTP in the list, login with your password as `mypassword,OTP`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 and my OTP is 330456 I would type (without quotes): `Ih3artdu0,330456`.
4. Note that the next time you login, you can either request a new list of OTPs using Step 2 and then enter the first OTP via Step 3, or you can just use the next OTP in the list, and skip directly to Step 3.

### Using Duo Phone Call

Duo also provides a phone call solution for 2-factor authorization if you only have a land line, or prefer to not use Push or SMS:

1. Type `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu` into the command line . For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,phone`. For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0 I would type: `Ih3artdu0,phone`
3. Wait for a phone call. Answer the call, select option #1, and you will automatically be logged in.

### Using the Duo Token

If you prefer a physical device, similar to the Vasco OTP.  You have to arrange with RC staff to acquire a token. There is a small fee for this device.  Email rc-help@colorado.edu for assistance.

1. `ssh username@login.rc.colorado.edu` . For example, if my username is jodo2018 I would type `ssh jodo2018@login.rc.colorado.edu`
2. Enter your password when prompted, as `mypassword,6-digit-number`. The 6-digit number is given to you on the Duo token.  For example, if my password is Ih3artdu0, and I press the button on the token and it is 123456, I would type: `Ih3artdu0,123456` 

## Managing Duo Devices

Users can manage their own Duo devices by visiting <a href="https://duo.colorado.edu">https://duo.colorado.edu</a>. This can allow users to add or remove activated devices at their discretion.

After a CU authorization page, you will be directed to a Duo authentication page. Do not respond to the Push notification and instead click the "Settings" button:

This will bring up a menu that provides several options on device management and general help. 

Clicking "Add a new device" will allow you to add a new smart phone, tablet, or land-line. Simply select the option you wish to add and follow the steps provided by Duo complete setting up your new device. 

Selecting "My Settings & Devices" provides a more detailed list of all devices you have registered. From here you can also add a new device, set your default device, and change your default authentication method when you attempt to log in.
