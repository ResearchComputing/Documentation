## Common Issues

If you are having issues logging into CURC services with Duo, you can enroll, re-enroll, change devices, and manage your 
Duo account by visiting the CU Duo self-service portal at [https://duo.colorado.edu](https://duo.colorado.edu).  

If you are not receiving a Duo prompt when attempting to log into CURC services, the following are possible issues and 
solutions: 

**Issue 1:** Your Duo account may have expired. The university purges Duo accounts after six months of non-use.  You can 
re-enroll by visiting [https://duo.colorado.edu](https://duo.colorado.edu).

**Issue 2:** You have changed your mobile device (e.g., purchased a new phone). You can add a new device to your duo account by 
following the instructions listed in the
[FAQ page](./faq.md#i-have-a-new-phone-as-a-cu-boulder-user-how-do-i-move-my-duo-onto-it).

If you need human assistance with Duo, contact the University helpdesk at <oithelp@colorado.edu> or call 303-735-4357.
