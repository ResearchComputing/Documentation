# Getting Started 

CU Research Computing (CURC) offers a variety of services encompassing High Performance Computing (HPC), cloud computing assistance, and storage solutions. Our team understands that navigating all of these areas can be overwhelming for both new and experienced users. To aid users, we have constructed flowcharts that outline the core areas of our documentation that every user on our system should become familiar with. Please refer to the section [High Performance Computing Flowchart](#high-performance-computing-flowchart) for a diagram on how to navigate our HPC systems (clusters) and storage solutions. For a diagram on the various cloud computing resources we can assist you with, please refer to the [Cloud Computing Flowchart](#cloud-computing-flowchart) section.

In the flowcharts presented below, you can easily navigate to the corresponding documentation page by clicking on the associated graph node. All nodes that change color when hovered over are clickable.

## High Performance Computing Flowchart

At CURC we host two HPC clusters, Alpine and Blanca, in addition to storage solutions. To utilize these resources there are several items that are important to be aware of. Although our documentation covers a variety of other topics, below we provide a flowchart that we believe identifies the key areas users of these services should read.
