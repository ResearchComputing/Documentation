Courses using RC Resources
--------------------------

Students are welcome to use RC resources on their own for class projects and can request access as a regular UCB affiliate via the link off the RC homepage at: https://www.colorado.edu/rc.  When requesting help please indicate that the work is for a class project and any deadlines.  
If students are to be required to use RC resources for a class, see below.

Instructors who wish to lead a class using RC resources must contact us at rc-help@colorado.edu before the class begins.  This is to insure that our resources can meet your needs and if adequate resources and support are available.
Early in the process we will need to know details about the proposed class usage such as:  

- Number of students  
- Software needed, and if it will be installed by instructor/TA  
- Typical computational work (number of jobs or sessions, length, number of CPUs)  
- Date if 1st usage in class/lab  
- Class roster including TAs and auditors.  

Acknowledging RC
----------------

Use of University of Colorado Research Computing resources, including (but not limited to) the Janus and Summit supercomputers, the Blanca Condo Cluster, and the PetaLibrary data storage service must be acknowledged in any and all publications.

**Acknowledging Summit:**
"This work utilized the Summit supercomputer, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (awards ACI-1532235 and ACI-1532236), the University of Colorado Boulder, and Colorado State University. The Summit supercomputer is a joint effort of the University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University."

**Acknowledging Blanca:**
"This work utilized the Blanca condo computing resource at the University of Colorado Boulder. Blanca is jointly funded by computing users and the University of Colorado Boulder."

**Acknowledging PetaLibrary:**
"Data storage supported by the University of Colorado Boulder 'PetaLibrary'"
