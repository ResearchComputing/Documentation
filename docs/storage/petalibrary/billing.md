# PetaLibrary Billing

## General information

PetaLibrary allocations are billed on a per-TB basis. Service begin
and end dates are rounded to the nearest whole month.  Refunds are not
provided, but you may transfer space between allocations. For example,
if you purchase two 5 TB allocations for one year, and after six months
no longer need one of the them, you may reallocate that space to the
remaining allocation, and have one 10 TB allocation for the remaining
six months.


## Services dates

The University of Colorado fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June
30. Whenever possible, we will not bill for PetaLibrary services across
multiple fiscal years. What this means is that for new allocations,
we will bill through the end of the current fiscal year, and follow
up with annual renewals. If you have grant begin and end dates that do
not line up with the university fiscal year, we will break up the time
period based on the begin and end dates of the fiscal year, and handle
billing in two transactions, each within the appropriate fiscal year.

If you have grant constraints that demand that billing will occur across multiple
fiscal years, such as a multi-year grant that may be depleted of funds
near the end of the grant period, we will find a way to make things
work. However, because billing across fiscal years
increases the complexity that our Finance, Planning & Procurement office
has to deal with, we will avoid this practice when at all possible.



## Invoicing

When a PetaLibrary billable event occurs, such as a request for additional
storage or a renewal being due, Research Computing will generate an
invoice. The invoice details the services being billed for, and includes
a speedtype. For new allocations, the speedtype will be the one provided
on the new allocation request form. For renewals or additional space,
the speedtype will be the last one used for the allocation in question. A
Journal ID will also be provided, which allows you to find the university
transaction in which funds are moved between speedtypes.

The invoice specifies a time frame for you to contact us to make
changes. If anything on the invoice is incorrect, please notify us right
away, and we will issue a new invoice. If we do not hear from you within
the specified time frame, we will proceed with the charges outlined in
the invoice.

If a PetaLibrary allocation has one or more billing contacts defined,
invoices are emailed to the billing contacts, and copied to the allocation
owner. If no billing contacts are defined, invoices are emailed to
the owner.
