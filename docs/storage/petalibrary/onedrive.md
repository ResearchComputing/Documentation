## Using RClone

### Step 1: Login to a compile node on Alpine

* Login to Alpine
* Load module Slurm, then start a compile job, then load module rclone
	```
	$ module load slurm
	$ acompile
	$ module load rclone
	```
* To test, run `rclone --version` at your prompt; if the software is installed a version number will be reported back to you, similar to:

	```
	$ rclone --version
	rclone v1.58.0
	```

### Step 2: configure OneDrive remote configuration

_Note: the steps below are also outlined in the [Rclone Documentation for OneDrive](https://rclone.org/onedrive/). We only list the critical steps. If a step is left out, assume you can select the default setting._

* Type `rclone config` to create a new profile for transferring files between OneDrive and PetaLibrary
* When prompted for whether to configure a “new” or “existing” profile, type `n` for "new remote"
* When prompted to name the new profile provide any descriptive name you like (e.g., `onedrive_johndoe_cu`)
* When prompted for the type of storage to configure, select the number of the option for "Microsoft OneDrive" (e.g., the number is "28" for _rclone v1.58.0_)
* When prompted for Client ID, leave the field blank
* When prompted for Client Secret, leave the field blank
* When prompted choose national cloud region for OneDrive, select the number of the option for "Microsoft Cloud Global (global)" (e.g., the number is "1" for _rclone v1.58.0_)
* When prompted with "Edit Advanced config?”, choose "n" for no (default). 
* When prompted with "Use Auto config?”, choose "n" for no (default). 
* You will then need to use your local machine's terminal to run 
	```
	$ rclone authorize "onedrive"
	```
	This will open a window in your your browser (you may be asked to authenticate to your Microsoft account). You will then be asked to allow Rclone to access the files in your `onedrive`. Complete this step to grant access.  If successful you'll receive a "success" message. 
* When prompted for Type of connection. Choose the appropriate answer, most likely "OneDrive Personal or Business (onedrive)" (e.g., the number is "1" for _rclone v1.58.0_)
* When prompted for the drive you want to use, choose the appropriate answer.
* When prompted asking if that drive is OK, choose the appropriate answer.
* Finally, you will be prompted to review the configuration and confirm whether it is okay. If everything looks okay, choose `yes` (default)
* Now type, `q` to quit the configuration. 

#### Now test your OneDrive remote!

On the Alpine compile node type:
```bash
$ rclone ls onedrive_johndoe_cu:
```
If this step fails, your OneDrive remote is not configured properly. Try reconfiguring your OneDrive remote again or contact [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu) for assistance.

### Step 3: Create your PetaLibrary remote configuration

See instructions for creating an [Rclone remote configuration for PetaLibrary](./rclone.md#configure-rclone)
