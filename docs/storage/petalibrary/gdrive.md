# Data Transfer between Google Drive and PetaLibrary

## Using Globus

_This capability is no longer available._

## Using RClone

### Step 1: Login to a compile node on Alpine

* Login to Alpine
* Load module Slurm, then start a compile job, then load module rclone
   ```
   $ module load slurm
   $ acompile
   $ module load rclone
   ```
* To test, run `rclone --version` at your prompt; if the software is installed a version number will be reported back to you, similar to:

   ```
   $ rclone --version
   rclone v1.58.0
   ```

### Step 2: configure google drive remote configuration

The steps below are also outlined in the [Rclone Documentation for Google Drive](https://rclone.org/drive/). We only list the critical steps. If a step is left out, assume you can select the default setting.

* Type `rclone config` to create a new profile for transferring files between Google Drive and PetaLibrary
* When prompted for whether to configure a “new” or “existing” profile type `n` for "new remote"
* When prompted to name the new profile provide any descriptive name you like (e.g., `gdrive_johndoe_cu`)
* When prompted for the type of storage to configure, select the number of the option for "Google Drive" (e.g., the number is "17" for _rclone_ v1.58.0)
* When prompted for Client ID, leave the field blank
* When prompted for Client Secret, leave the field blank
* When prompted for scope that rclone should use when requesting access from Drive enter '1' for full drive access
* When prompted for root_folder_id, leave the field blank unless you'd like to specify a different root folder
* When prompted for service_account_file, leave the field blank
* When prompted to edit advanced config, choose "N" for no (default)
* When prompted for "Use Auto config?” choose "N" for no (default). Rclone will print a command in the form of:
   ```
   $ rclone authorize "drive" "<token>"
   ```
   Copy this command and run it on your local machine (rclone must be installed). This will open your web browser to authenticate with your Google account.
* Once you are in your browser, you may be asked to authenticate to your Google account, and then you will be asked to allow Rclone to access the files in your `gdrive`. Complete this step to grant access.  If successful you'll receive a "success" message. 
* On your local machine, rclone will print out a token. Copy everything between the arrows as directed and paste in the config_token field in your Alpine terminal
* When prompted for whether you want to configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive). Choose the appropriate answer; if this is your personal Drive account then choose `no` (default)
* Finally, you will be prompted to review the configuration and confirm whether it is okay. If everything looks okay, choose `yes` (default)
* Now type `q` to quit the configuration. 

#### Now test your Google Drive remote!

On your local machine type:
```bash
$ rclone ls gdrive_johndoe_cu
```
If this step fails, your Google Drive remote is not configured properly. Try reconfiguring your Google Drive remote again or contact <rc-help@colorado.edu> for assistance.

### Step 3: Create your PetaLibrary remote configuration

See instructions for creating an [Rclone remote configuration for PetaLibrary](./rclone.md#configure-rclone)
