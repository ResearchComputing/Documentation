1. [I am a BioKEM facility user, how do I have my data deposited to my PetaLibrary Allocation?](#biokem-facility-data-deposit)

### BioKem Facility Data Deposit

If you are a BioKEM facility user, you can choose to have your data deposited directly into your PetaLibrary allocations. This process involves creating a biokem-deposit directory in your allocationâ€™s root directory and setting permissions to a biokem specific owner and group. Visit [our documentation](../../additional-resources/biokem-facility.html) on the BioKEM facility to learn about the process.
