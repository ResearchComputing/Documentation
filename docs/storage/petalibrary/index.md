# Introduction

The PetaLibrary is a University of Colorado Boulder Research Computing service that supports the storage, archival, and sharing of research data. It is available to any researcher affiliated with the University of Colorado System (Boulder, Anschutz, Denver, Colorado Springs) at an internal cost rate. It is available at an external cost rate to researchers from other RMACC institutions.  General information can be found here. Information on specific topics can be found in the menu to the left.
 
## Requesting a PetaLibrary allocation

Request PetaLibrary storage by selecting "Request a new PetaLibrary allocation" on the [RC PetaLibrary page](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/petalibrary). 

```{note}
* Minimum allocation size: 1 TB
* Maximum _initial_ allocation size for new customers, pending availability:
    * 200 TB in Active storage
    * 100 TB in Archive storage (includes "Active+Archive" and "Archive+DR")
```

## Requirements

### Ownership
Each PetaLibrary allocation *must* define an allocation owner, read more about PetaLibrary [owners and contacts and their individual roles/responsibilities](./ownership.md). 

### CURC Account

Each person who accesses the PetaLibrary is required to have a Research Computing account and Duo two-factor authentication. PetaLibrary storage is presented as a file system directory based on the type of allocation. For more information about obtaining a CURC account, see our [Logging In](../../getting_started/logging-in.md) page. 

### Access
Access to a PetaLibrary allocation is granted using an access group. This group may be an existing group in the Research Computing environment or a new group created specifically for the purpose of managing access to the allocation. 

To add new users to the allocation, the allocation owner or their authorized technical contact can email the RC help desk at <rc-help@colorado.edu> at any time to request that the users be added to the access group. 

## Performance
PetaLibrary is a shared infrastructure and the instantaneous performance will vary depending on each individual workload and competing workloads from other clients.

The PetaLibrary service is designed for file storage and retrieval, and is not an ideal service for highly transactional workloads (e.g., relational databases).
