# PetaLibrary Ownership and Contacts

## PetaLibrary Owners

Every PetaLibrary allocation must have one owner. The owner is permitted
to make any changes to the allocation, including file permissions,
allocation size, and destruction of data. The owner is responsible for
furnishing payment for PetaLibrary expenses.

The owner may opt to replace themselves by designating a new owner, when
appropriate. In the event a former PetaLibrary owner is not available
to designate a new owner, the owner of the speedtype that was last used
to pay for a PetaLibrary allocation may designate a new owner.

An optional _technical contact_ and _billing contact_ may also be defined. These contacts are treated as delegates of the allocation owner for normal or regular operation.

## PetaLibrary billing contacts

A PetaLibrary allocation may have one or more billing contacts. A billing
contact may speak on behalf of the owner of an allocation, making any
change that an owner would, except designating a new owner.

If RC has a billing question about an allocation, and billing contacts
are present, we will send email to the billing contact(s) and cc: the
allocation owner. If no billing contacts are specified, we will email
the allocation owner.

## PetaLibrary technical contacts

A PetaLibrary allocation may have one or more technical
contacts. Technical contacts are largely identical to billing contacts,
in that they may speak on behalf of the owner of an allocation, short
of designating a new owner.

RC will email technical contacts, if present, of an allocation regarding
technical issues, and cc: the owner. In the absense of technical contacts,
RC will email the allocation owner.

## Recommended owner/contacts

In most cases, PetaLibrary allocation owners are principal investigators
for one or more grants. If the allocation is being funded with a fund 30
speedtype (begins with 13), it is strongly recommended that the allocation
owner be listed on the grant. The Campus Controller's Office may check
that fund 30 speedtype charges can be associated with names on grants
associated with a fund 30 speedtype.

Billing and technical contacts can both make decisions on behalf of
allocation owners, so the only reason we track them separately is so that
RC has a better chance of contacting the correct people for billing or
technical issues.
